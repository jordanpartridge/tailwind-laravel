## Tailwind Laravel 

I need to wrap my head around tailwind and laravel. I have been using bootstrap for a long time and I am very comfortable with it. I have been hearing a lot about tailwind and I want to give it a try. I am going to use it with laravel because I am very comfortable with laravel. I am going to document my journey here.

I will be walking through the guide here:
https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/laravel

this will be on a fresh Laravel 11 installation with pest for any testing I may do.
